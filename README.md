# Embedding the List of Post-Scarcity Related Efforts

The list is located at `https://nextkind.org/links/?version=1` as a JSON list and can be read by scripts and displayed on any website. You could copy/paste the list to your website manually but scripting it will ensure the list will always display updated.

- `icon` and `tags` are not mandatory and may be missing, please take them into account when displaying list items.
- Please display the `note` somewhere around the list, so visitors can find out they can embed this list on their website too (which will probably boost your traffic).
